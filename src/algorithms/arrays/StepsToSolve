Algorithms:

I.Smallest and largest Value Array:

Content of task: "Find Smallest and Largest Element in an Array"

steps:
1. Initialise two variable and name as largest and smallest with array first position arr[0]
2. Iterate over array
3.
    a)If current element is greater than largest then assign current element to largest.
    b)If current element is smaller than smallest then assign current element to smallest.
4.Output smallest and largest number in table first and second position.

II. Missing number in array

Content of task: "find missing number in an Array"

steps:
1. Find the sum of n number using formula "n=n*(n+1)/2"
2. Find the sum of elements present in given array
3. Substract(sum of n numbers - sum of elements present in the array)
