Algorithms:

I.Reverse String:

Content of task: "How to reverse a String in java?"

steps:
1. Declare empty string for reverse output
2. Iterate over array using for loop from last index to first
3. Add character to output String during iterating

II. Anagram

Content of task: "Write a java program to check if two Strings are anagram in java?"

steps:
a)
1. Word and anagram as method's parameters
2. Iterate over String word and get char c by charAt()
3. If index of char is -1 in second String anagram, then two strings are not anagrams
4. If you get empty String in the end, then two Strings are anagrams of each other

b)
1. Word and anagram as method's parameters
2. If length are not this same then they are not anagrams
3. create an array of 256 length
4. Iterate over string word
5. In each iteration, we increment count of word and decrement count of anagram
6. If count of any character is not 0 at the end, it means that two strings are not anagrams
