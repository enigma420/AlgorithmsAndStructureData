I.Stack using Linked List

Content of task: "Implement stack using Linked List"

steps:
1. Create Node class with int data and Node next fields
2. Create SinglyLinkedList class with Node head field
3. Create method isEmpty() which checks if linkedlist is empty
4. Create insertFirst() for insert a node at the start of linked list
5. Create deleteFirst() for delete node from start of linked list
6. Create deleteAfter() for delete node after particular node
7. Create insertLast() for insert a node at the end of linked list
8. Crate printLinkedList() for printing linked list
