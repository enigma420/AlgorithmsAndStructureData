I.Queue using Linked List

Content of task: "Implement Queue using Linked List"

steps:
1. Create QueueUsingLinkedList class and declare int currentSize and Node front,rear
2. Create nest class "Node" which stores int data and Node next
3. Create constructor for QueueUsingLinkedList class where initialize front and rear as null and currentSize = 0
4. Create method isEmpty() which checks if the LinkedList is empty
5. Create method dequeue() which assign front.data and front.next to data and front. If isEmpty then rear = null. If not then decrement currentSize and reutnr data
6. Create method enqueue() with int data parameter which assign current rear to oldRear and create new rear instanceof Node. Assign data to rear.data and null to rear.next
After checks if the LinkedList is empty then assign rear to front otherwise assign rear to oldRear.next . In the end we need to increment currentSize value;
