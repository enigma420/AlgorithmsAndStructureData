I.Stack using Linked List

Content of task: "Implement stack using Linked List"

steps:
1. Create nest class "Node" which define LinkedList node with int value and Node next
2. declare in LinkedListStack first node with name "head"
3. Create method pop() which check that head is null then throw LinkedListEmptyException() and assign head value to returned value also assign head next to head
4. Create method push() which assign head to oldHead, declare new Node head and assigns value to head.value and oldHead to head.next
*Create Exception class which extends from RuntimeException which throw exception in case of head is null
